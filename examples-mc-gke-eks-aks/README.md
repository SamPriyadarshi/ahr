# GCP/AWS or GCP/AWS/Azure VPN Topologies

This terraform project allows you to install non-default networking on either GCP/AWS or GCP/AWS/Azure combo with jumpboxes on each cloud and a sample 7000,7001 ports allowed to communication across clouds.

Of course, you need an active account at each of the two or three clouds.
